# TIPE-drone
During the TIPE (an essai in order to enter ingeneering schools) about urbanism, I studied how could a drone make delivery in a city, without knowing the map of the city it was in. I made an algorithm in C++ to simulate the behavior of this drone, and how it could dodge the buildings with captors.
