# TIPE-drone
During the TIPE (an essai in order to enter ingeneering schools) about urbanism, I studied how could a drone make delivery in a city, without knowing the map of the city it was in. I made an algorithm in C++ to simulate the behavior of this drone, and how it could dodge the buildings.

Because the algorithm doesn't know the map, I could not use Djikstra's algorithm, so I decided to use "captors".

The project doesn't work perfectly for every map, but have fun with it !

To use it :
- use visualStudio to run it
- press z to update the drone position
- press esc to close the window
